# SI Units

Where do they come from? 

The Si units are a coherent system of units, which is where a system of units can be combined using products of powers of a set of 'base units', with one another to create more complex 'derived units.'

How are they defined?

Each unit has a prescribed constant associated with it. These constants have an axiomatic numerical value when expressed with the SI unit, for each of these units the International Bureau of Weights and Measures has a prescribed technique for realising these units, though it stresses that any solution consistent with current physics understanding is also a valid method for deriving these units.

a brief history:
SI units originated as a result of the centimetre - second - gram system, a system which seeked to define all units using only those three base units. However it had two sets of units for the electrostatis and electromechanics, which was only resolved by introducing the Ampere to the system (which at this point was now metres - second - kilogram). These two sets of units could be converted between with a ratio that was the speed of light, then following Maxwell's paper, which ultimately unified the two, did this relation become explained - with the proposed electromagnetic wave - aka light - which travels with constant speed, $c = \frac{1}{\sqrt(\mu_0 \epsilon_r)}$.

There has been a push in the scientific community to define these units not using artefacts - which can naturally change with time and introduce irremovable uncertaintities when replicating - and instead towards idealised and abstract definitons, which do not suffer from such limitations. Thus in 2019 there was a redefinition of kilogram, ampere, mole and kelvin, to not use physical artefacts but instead to also use physical constants those expressed above. The BIMP publish an article expressing how these units can be realised as well as detailed descriptions of the definition to allow for reproducibilty and accuracy.
