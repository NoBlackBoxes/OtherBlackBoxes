# SI Units

Where do they come from? 

The Si units are a coherent system of units, which is where a system of units can be combined using products of powers of a set of 'base units', with one another to create more complex 'derived units.'

How are they defined?

Each unit has a prescribed constant associated with it. These constants has an axiomatic numerical value when written with the SI unit, for each of these units the International Bureau of Weights and Measures has a prescribed technique for realising these units, though it expresses that any solution consistent with current physics understanding is also a valid method for deriving these units.

the 7 base units and their corrosponding constants:
|The Unit|What it measures|the corrosponding constant|
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
|second | time | hyperfine transmission frequency of caesium|
|metre | distance | speed of light|
|kilogram | mass | Planck's constant|
|ampere | current | elementary charge (charge of an electron)|
|kelvin | tempertaure | Boltzman constant|
|mole | an avocadro's number of something | Avogadro's number|
|candela | intensity of light | luminous efficacy|

a brief history:
SI units originated as a result that the centimetre - second - gram system, a system which seeked to define all units using only those three base units, however it had two sets of units for the electrostatis and elecromechanics, which was only resolved by introducing the Ampere to the system (which at this point was now metres - second - kilogram). These differed by the speed of light, then following maxwell's paper, which ultimately unified the two fields, did this relation become explained - with the proposed electromagnetic wave - aka light - which travels with constant speed, c = 1/sqrt(mu_0 epsilon_r).

There has been a push in the scientific community to define these units not using artefacts - which can naturally change with time and introduce irremovable uncertaintities when replicating - and instead towards idealised and abstract definitons, which do not suffer from such limitations. Thus in 2019 there was a redefinition of kilogram, ampere, mole and kelvin, to not use physical artefacts but instead to also use physical constants those expressed above.


TO Do for demonstration:

- calc c
to calc c require:
vacuum permiability
Vacuum permittivity



- calc e
- calc boltzman??
