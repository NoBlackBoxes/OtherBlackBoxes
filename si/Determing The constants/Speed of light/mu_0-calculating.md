Determening the value of $\mu_O$

Equipment:
Two straight uncovered metal rods
a mass balance
two power supplies
an ammeter
four cables
A support for the two rods
likely some tape

Method:
attach one rod to the scale as well as two wires to the rod. Then connect thsose wire to one of the power supplies
using the other power supply attach the second set of cables to that and run them across the other rod
suspend the second rod a small distance directly aboce parallel to the first rod. making sure to provide it support
then take a reading of the distance between the rods and then zero the scale.
then run a current through both wires of opposite directions aka one positive when read with the ameter and the other negative
using the ammeter make a measurement of both currents and record the mass present on the scale.

Result:
Using: $F=mg$ and $F=l\frac{\mu_0I_1I_2}{2\pi r}$
and equating the two equations and then rearranging the value of $\mu_0 can be calculated$
