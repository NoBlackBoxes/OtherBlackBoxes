Determining $\epsilon_0$ 

Equipment:
two aluminum plates
four small plastic washers
a capcitancemeter
ruler
calipers
large rubber bands or clamps (be sure they are not going to conduct any  electricity if in cotact with the plates)

Method:
Measure the area of each plate, using the ruler.
then placing the washers in the corners of the plate and sandwich them with the seecond plate.
then using the rubber bands/clamps to apply pressure to the capacitor.
Then take a reading of its capacitance using the meter, as well as the thickness of the four washers 
finally using the rearranged form of $C=\frac{\epsilon_0A}{d}$, $\epsilon_0=\frac{dC}{A}$.

Demonstration:

The final result:

the value of c is
