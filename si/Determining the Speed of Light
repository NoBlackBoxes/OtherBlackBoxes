The speed of light is used to derive the value of a metre so a logical place to begin determining a meter is a value for the speed of light.
To do this we will require the four Maxwell equations in a vacuum:


$\grad\cdot E = 0$
$\grad\cdpt B = 0$
$\grad\cross E = - \frac{\partial B}{\partial t}$
$\grad\cross B = \mu_0\epsilon_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}$

and the vector identity:
$\grad\cross V = \grad\cdot(\grad V) - \grad^2 V$

We thus substitute in MAxwell 3 and MAxwell 4 into the vector identity to see what results out.

Starting with Maxwell 3:
$\grad\cross(\grad\cross E)$
$ = \grad\cross(- \frac{\partial B}{\partial t)$ substituting in the right hand side of Maxwell 3
reulting in:
$\grad\cross(\grad\cross E) =  \grad\cross(- \frac{\partial B}{\partial t)$

then continuing on the left hand side we expand out using the vector identity for:
$\grad\cdot(\grad\cross E) - \grad^2 E = \grad\cross(- \frac{\partial B}{\partial t)$
noting that curl of div results in zero it simplifies down to:
$ - \grad^2 E = \grad\cross(- \frac{\partial B}{\partial t)$
if we then view the partial derivitve as an operator, we can then rearrange the partial term resulting in
$ - \grad^2 E = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\grad\cross B)$
then using Maxwell 4 we recieve the relation
$ - \grad^2 E =  \mu_0\epsilson_0\frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial t^2}$

we then repeat this for Maxwell 4 but nootice instead the need to substitute Maxwell 3:


$\grad\cross(\grad\cross B)$
$ = \grad\cross(\mu_)\epsilon_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t)$
$\grad\cross(\grad\cross B) = \grad\cross(\mu_)\epsilon_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t)$
LHS:
$\grad\cdot(\grad\cross B) - \grad^2 B = \grad\cross(\mu_)\epsilon_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t)$
$ - \grad^2 B = \grad\cross(\mu_)\epsilon_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t)$
$ - \grad^2 B = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\grad\cross E)$
$ - \grad^2 B =  \mu_0\epsilson_0\frac{\partial^2 B}{\partial t^2}$


these clearly both match the form of the wave equation ($\grad^2 "wave" = \frac{1}{"speed"^2} \frac{\partial^2 "wave"}{\partial t^2}$), 
so we assume as they share constant terms that the speed of the electromagnetic wave (this idea of a single field comes from how closely related the two fields -
are and that thus they must be a the same field) or a wave of light, must be constatn at a value of

$c = \frac{1}{\sqrt(\mu_0\epsilson_0)}$

with this knowledge we must set about determining values of both $\mu_0$ and $\epsilon_0$ to calcualte c, to determine the length of a metre.
