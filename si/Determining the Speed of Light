The speed of light is used to derive the value of a metre so a logical place to begin determining a meter is a value for the speed of light.
To do this we will require the four Maxwell equations in a vacuum:


$\grad\cdot E = 0$
$\grad\cdpt B = 0$
$\grad\cross E = - \frac{\partial B}{\partial t}$
$

and the vector identity:
