Email Subject: Can contain named fields, like {Group ID}.
Dear
---
The email message goes here. There can be special fields, such as: {Last Name}
    
Is the following address correct?

    {Institution}, {Department}
    {Street Address}
    {Street Address Line 2}
    {City}, {State / Province}, {Postal / Zip Code}
    {Country}

You can use any named field (column) in the associated ODS file, such as {Number} or {String} fields.
You can re-use the same fields, like {Number} and {Group ID}.

You can maybe use HTML tag to make things <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i>.

...and to add <a href="https://www.noblackboxes.org">links</a>

Sincerely,
Adam and Elena
