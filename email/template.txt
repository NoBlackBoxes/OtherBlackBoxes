Email Subject: Can contain named fields, like <Group ID>.
Dear
---
The email message goes here. There can be special fields, such as: <Last Name>
    
Is the following address correct?

    <Institution>, <Department>
    <Street Address>
    <Street Address Line 2>
    <City>, <State / Province>, <Postal / Zip Code>
    <Country>

You can use any named field (column) in the associated ODS file, such as <Number> or <String> fields.
You can re-use the same fields, like <Number> and <Group ID>.
